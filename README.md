# Terrainier
Read up all about what it is, and what we're trying to do on our [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/terrainier)!

# Command to bundle `index.js`:
`browserify index.js -p esmify > bundle.js`

# Setup
* Make sure you have/create an `auth.json` in the `backend/` folder with your Maps API key, and [Darksky API key](https://darksky.net/dev/account) present
```json
{
    "MAPS_KEY": <your-key>,
    "DARKSKY_KEY": <your-key> 
}
```
* Install and configure [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) and [Vectiler](https://github.com/karimnaaji/vectiler). 
* Create another file in `/backend` called `paths.json`, and add the paths to your blender executable and vectiler build, so we can call them from ther terminal later on. My file is like this:
```json
{
    "blender": "/home/rohan/Downloads/blender/blender",
    "vectiler" : "/home/rohan/Desktop/Cpp_files/vectiler/build/vectiler.out"
}
```
if you have them in $PATH already, then just replace it with the normal command that can be called from terminal.
* Install `flask` and `flask-restful` in your python environment

# To Run:
* In a terminal, navigate to `/backend` and run `python server.py`(should be on port 5000)
* Host `index.html` using node's `http-server` or VsCode's [Live-Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

# Miscellaneous
### Vectiler command to generate testing terrain:
`./vectiler.out --tilex 23447/23448 --tiley 15191/15192 --tilez 15 --terrain 1 --buildings 1 --terrainExtrusionScale 1.5 --buildingsExtrusionScale 1.9`
### Random place in sg [for testing]
Latitude 1.3342035847226605, Longitude 103.84775028228756

# Learning and stuff
* Learnt after a while that the API key should in fact be got from the server side [Implemented via an API call], and not the client side, with me trying to load it from a `.env` file earlier

# Known unexpected behaviour
* If the 3d model generated by vectiler has a flat base, that will be marked red too. This is because the blender script marks all flat surfaces (with normal = z axis) as red. So in that sense, it's really looking for flat surfaces, not building tops. But in most of the testing, building tops are the only surfaces which are flat.
* The recommendations under "Select location for recommendations" are random. We have yet to link it with the data from our charts.
* The marker location on the map is only captured once a zoom is performed, and not immediately.
